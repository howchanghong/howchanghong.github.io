      <description>Work has been life these days and the bustling pace can be overwhelming without giving myself a time to reflect. Seeing my brother’s note to do this particular challenge, I’m inspired to do personal reflections myself too. In addition, after making a bet with Yunhan, I shall attempt to make a new experience every week. Thus, the objectives of this challenge are: Reflect on events that happened this week and, How I felt, what influenced my decisions and what can be done better.</description>
