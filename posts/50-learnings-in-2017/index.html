<p>Work has been life these days and the bustling pace can be overwhelming without giving myself a time to reflect. Seeing my brother’s note to do this particular challenge, I’m inspired to do personal reflections myself too. In addition, after making a bet with Yunhan, I shall attempt to make a new experience every week. Thus, the objectives of this challenge are:
Reflect on events that happened this week and,
How I felt, what influenced my decisions and what can be done better.
Improve on my written language.
One new experience every week. To make it realistic, going to new malls and eateries shall count as exploring! :)
I will be posting in this space every Sunday after breakfast (or anytime some epiphany comes into mind). 2017 here we go!</p>

<h2 id="1-however-busy-things-can-get-there-s-always-time-for-a-drink-with-those-i-care">1: However busy things can get, there’s always time for a drink with those I care.</h2>

<p>It has not exactly been the most amazing first week of any year given the amount of OT I’m already having. With the limited amount of time left after working hours, there is always a choice to make to either spend time for myself or to hang out. Time is precious so I choose who I want to surround myself with.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 1: Going to Decathlon at Bedok.</p>

<h2 id="2-bike-shedding-and-the-law-of-triviality">2: Bike Shedding and the Law of Triviality.</h2>

<p>It is always easy for those who stand outside the situation to criticise and provide their opinions as they do not have a stake in the problem. However, what they attempt to contribute, more often then not, do not strike the crux of the issues as they cannot comprehend the complexity of the situation. I will need to be wary of the opinions I give when I sit on the other fence.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 2: Going to TOYOGO at Lavender.</p>

<h2 id="3-dwysywd">3: DWYSYWD.</h2>

<p>Do what you say you would do. There are many times where token comments are made to either pacify the opposing parties or to project a certain image. And because these words do not mean anything, no substantial actions are carried afterwards. It is always easy to say or comment but to act on it takes determination and passion.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 3: Volunteer at Music for a Cause.</p>

<h2 id="4-reputation">4: Reputation.</h2>

<p>It is me but bigger than me, precedes me and persists after I leave. Legacy is what reputation is after we die. To leave a legacy, we have to build a reputation when we are alive. And we have to guard it with our life because it takes years to build it but seconds to destroy. Reputation affects how others treat us even before they know us. It affects the conversations held not with us but behind us. And it opens/closes opportunities that are not yet made known to us. Work hard to build it when we are young and stand up to defend it with even more vigor.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 4: First CNY celebration in 4 years.</p>

<h2 id="5-talking-an-ineffectual-solution">5: Talking: An ineffectual solution.</h2>

<p>While discussions are important to devise a plan, they are often dragged on in a desultory way, with a great deal of rhetoric and minimum substance. What irks me the most is the fact that no concrete solution or decisions are made despite all the efforts and time put into it. I prefer action, even if it simply just means penning down the plan. This sets an objective direction in which the discussion can move towards. Drawing from the Agile development concept, we should strive to provide iterative and incremental improvements to the solution.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 5: Help out at foreign worker CNY celebration.</p>

<h2 id="6-projections">6: Projections.</h2>

<p>We make projections everyday to help us make decisions even without the full knowledge of the topic. Projections go a step beyond assumption in that it has a logical extension to the idea. However, the difficulty in the art of drawing projections is to know how far we can extend along the plane of truth, beyond which it is baseless assumption.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 6: Dinner with Wushu.</p>

<h2 id="7-do-enough-not-to-regret">7: Do enough not to regret.</h2>

<p>There are times when we are unsure about opportunities that come by. It may either be too radical, and/or status quo is too much to give up. This will lead to dilemma on whether to act on the opportunity that come by. I think the correct approach would be to do enough (either by trying it out or preparing for the opportunity) so as not to regret having not done any actions at all. In the process of putting in effort and thought, the answer will often surface by itself. If it resonates, then seize the opportunity. If not, at least you will have a good night sleep and not having any regret.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 7: Lunch at Paddy Hills.</p>

<h2 id="8-on-time-is-late">8: On time is late.</h2>

<p>I went out on three occasions this week and I was late for two of them. I feel bad about it as I broke the agreement that I had made with my friends. On both occasions, I intentionally left an hour early to account for the traveling time. Yet, I was still late due to terrible traffic conditions. I blame myself for not factoring such unforeseen circumstances and it bothers me because I had just wasted and disregarded my friends’ time. Having said so, I was not the only one who was late but I do wonder if they (late friends) feel the same. If I am going to be late, I should be responsible for it and at least do:
  Tell the meeting participants I would be late and an approximate time I would be arriving.
Update them on my whereabouts so they do not have to be anxious in waiting.
Upon reaching, apologise first, no matter how valid the reason was.
Tell my (possible) excuse and hope that my friends are understanding.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 8: Chung Cheng for training.</p>

<h2 id="9-accuracy">9: Accuracy.</h2>

<p>Friend 1: I am very loyal to my girlfriend.
Friend 2: Loyal is for dogs. Faithful, my friend.
Words help us communicate by expressing our thoughts, ideas and feelings. However, inaccurate use of words can send the wrong messages across. This can lead to misunderstanding of intent or worse, inaccurate denunciation of the sender’s position on a matter. Thus, it is important we make a conscious effort to be accurate in communicating the correct information in both written and spoken forms.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 9: Drinks at Lantern with EOCC.</p>

<h2 id="10-i-don-t-know">10: I don’t know.</h2>

<p>These three words are one of the hardest to say. It hurts the ego, the credibility and the confidence in a person. Which is why people choose to cover the fact that they do not know the answers to questions by either throwing jargon or beat around the bush to confuse the audience. However, this does not help in clarifying the situation and if seen through the act, it causes the audience to lose respect with the speaker. In my opinion, a better approach would be to:
Acknowledge my gap in knowledge.
Provide relevant knowledge and what my opinion on the answer might be.
Promise to find out the correct answer.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 10: Bukit Timah Hill climb with family.</p>

<h2 id="11-wayang">11: Wayang.</h2>

<p>I couldn’t find an English word that replaces this Singlish word as accurately and succinctly. People often try to put up a false front to impress their authorities. While I feel that it is perfectly fine to put one’s best foot forward when presenting oneself, there are times when the effort to do so go over and beyond the reality on the ground. This is counter-productive as  it projects an inaccurate situation picture to the higher management. Furthermore, efforts to provide purely aesthetic enhancements to the presentations could be directed to more value-adding products. However, it should be noted that the authority of the audience is important in deciding whether the effort to wayang can reap potential benefits. If the authority is influential and interested in the project, he/she could potentially bring in more resources then it might be a worthwhile effort after all.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 11: Chinese Garden.</p>

<h2 id="12-where-the-wind-blows">12: Where the wind blows.</h2>

<p>Imagine you are a plant. If you are a lallang, you go where ever the wind brings you. You make no self decisions on the direction you are headed to, and you are not bothered at where it will bring you. Or you can be a tree, big and strong. No matter how hard the wind blows, you stand rooted to the ground, not budging a bit. It seems that you know that the place you are at is where you want to be and no amount of persuasion can move you. Or you can be a carrot, growing underneath the ground and being totally oblivious to where ever the wind blows. And life is like wind, it changes all the time. We can either be wish-washy and go with the flow or we can choose to ignore all the changes around us. But if I were to choose, I want to be a tree; to be able to grow from the principles that are rooted in me amidst the changes happening around. Only then, I will be able to stand for what I am and choose where I want to be.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 12: Baby niece one month anniversary.</p>

<h2 id="13-honeypot">13: Honeypot.</h2>

<p>When an deal that is too sweet presents itself, one must always wonder if there is any tiny T&amp;C that goes along with it. A deal is an exchange of goods/service that is of equal value. If the deal looks favorable to me, there must be something of value that I have that the other party deems as of equal value. It is always good to consider what I might provide for the seller before jumping into it.
What happens if we are the seller? Could we also make use of the technique to obtain some value out of unknowing  buyers? Could we divert the attention to low hanging fruits so that less concern would be placed by the consumer to obtain the higher value objects? Could we make sure that our bosses focus on the bike sheds instead of the nuclear plant?</p>

<p>New Experience ## 13: NUS Friday Hacks by Jack Moss and Halvar Flake.</p>

<h2 id="14-commitment">14: Commitment.</h2>

<p>For two people to be together, it takes initiative. For two people to stay together, it takes commitment. This applies to all relationships: couples, friends and family. When we are young, our social circle revolves around the few friends we meet as classmates. And because we do not have much going on with our life, we spend a lot of time with them. As we grow older, we get to know more people and adult responsibilities come in to play. Given a limited amount of time resources, we juggle between having a social life, getting work done and spending quality time alone. We become more selective with who we choose to hang out with. We sacrifice our personal time to find out more about the partner’s situation, make the effort to stay within his/her life and share their emotions. To give this much requires commitment. Commitment to turn up for the meeting, commitment to keep in touch, commitment that the relationship is worth fighting for.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 14: Interview at 1925.</p>

<h1 id="15-islam">15: Islam.</h1>

<p>With so many happenings around that revolves Islam and its teachings, I decided to educate myself on why and how it is influencing these movements. This learning mostly comes from a book called “Islam, The Essentials” by Tariq Ramadan.
Prophet Muhammad was born in 570 CE at Mecca. His father died before he was born, then his mother, then his grandfather and finally his uncle Abu Talib who was a shepherd raised him. He grew up to be a very successful businessman who married Khadijah. Muhammad was to receive a message from Archangel Gabriel that he would be the God’s messenger at the age of forty. He would receive more Revelations over the next 23 years which he preach to his people. The Message has four cardinal points:
Faith in the uniqueness of God.
Qur’an as the word of God.
The imperative of prayers and good deed.
Return to God on Judgement Day.
However, his preaching were met with rejection from the Meccan aristocracy and his people were persecuted. The Prophet taught his people that war and conflict were to be avoided, and conciliation and the preservation of peace were to be sought by all means. This passive resistance led to strong persecution, leading to murders of Muslim. In order to survive without retaliation, the Prophet and his followers began the migration - the Heigra -  to seek shelter in Medina. Despite all of these, they continued to be attacked. Under these circumstances, a verse that allows self-defence was revealed: “Permission [to fight] is given to those against whom war is being wrongfully waged - and, verily, God has indeed the power to succour them”. Muhammad never initiated hostilities but only respond to his aggressors. When the oppressor ultimately chooses peace, all violence must cease.
There is still many more to the story which I would want to understand more. Only through the journey which I seek knowledge, can I understand the world I live in and the people in it.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 15: Backstreet hawker at JB.</p>

<h2 id="16-procrastinate-on-purpose">16: Procrastinate on Purpose.</h2>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a prisoner on a death row. When it was his turn to be hanged, he pleaded with the emperor to spare his life. The emperor asked him what he can provide in return. He said, “I will turn your horse into a flying horse in one year’s time.”
The horse does not turn into a flying horse and he gets hanged in one year.
The emperor dies and he gets pardon from the new emperor.
The horse really turned into a flying horse.
We are always in a rush to finish our to-do list. While we are taught to prioritise our tasks, doing the more important tasks first do not give us more time. We still take the same amount of time to complete all the work. However, if we can procrastinate and sit on certain things, those that are not as important might simply go away. Now this, it creates time. It saves us time from doing those things that do not matter as much. So sit back, and relax!</p>

<p>New Experience ## 16: Kranji farm.</p>

<h2 id="17-if-you-don-t-live-life-life-will-leave-you">17: If you don&rsquo;t live life, life will leave you.</h2>

<p>A word of wisdom from a gramp while eating pancakes in Amsterdam. Despite all the time we spend at work, there should be something that lies beyond it. Be it family, friends or passion. Because at the end of our life, we are not measured by the hours that we spent working but the hours we spent enjoying. This also directs us to find work that are our  passions as well. I might not know what my true passions are, but if I know the work I am doing is not right for me, I must have the courage to search for opportunities, to seek my passion, to find work that aligns with my heart.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 17: Alkmaar Cheese Market</p>

<h2 id="18-discrimination">18:  Discrimination.</h2>

<p>A show of power? A need for a common goal (of discrimination) within a fraternity​? Or simple evil human nature? We have preconceived notions of people to help us make judgments faster; in ancient times to determine friend or foe and  in today&rsquo;s context, whether the person is trust worthy or not. This helps to improve our survivability by drawing on such projected information(stereotype) from our knowledge of the community and impose them on the new subject. We do not know his characters, his values, his stories and yet we make judgments base on his colour, religion or gender. Our survival instincts might have served us well but it must progress with the advancement of civilisation and the pressure of globalisation. While it might be my nature to form judgments, I must make a conscious effort to stay open and look at the person for who he is.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 18: A Comedy of a Bank Robbery.</p>

<h2 id="19-bitching">19: Bitching.</h2>

<p>We all do that, and love to do it. It gives us an avenue of emotional relief, an opportunity to share our pains and perhaps seek understanding of the situation through repetition which gives us time to reflect. However, we must be wary not to target the nature of the person(bitch) or we will be bigots, but rather his/her actions. This way we can keep our bitching sessions objective and even purposeful in learning through the mistakes of others. Furthermore, what we bitch(verb) about we must be prepared and willing to communicate directly back to the bitch(noun) or we will just be hypocrites. Bitch but don’t be a bitch.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 19: Haji Lane.</p>

<h2 id="20-hobby">20: Hobby.</h2>

<p>A hobby helps gives things we do with our leisure time meaning. It embodies the passion of the person, the discipline of the mind and the spirit of the hobby’s community. It makes a person’s life richer and his character stronger as he goes through the hours pursuing  the hobby. Personally, I have been trying to pick up sports related hobbies (e.g. badminton, touch rugby and running) as it helps to make my evenings fruitful. Sports hobbies engage both the body and mind and allow for interaction with friends. However, they are time-limited luxuries which I might not be able to enjoy in the distant future. Time is ticking every second&hellip;</p>

<p>New Experience ## 20: Touch Rugby at Kallang.</p>

<h2 id="21-interests-rights-power-irp">21: Interests, Rights, Power (IRP).</h2>

<p>To solve any disputes, IRP are the three basic elements. In using Power, we can try to either coerce a response by show of force. This is achievable when one party has significant capacity and resources to force the other party to conform to his demands. A manager may hold the employees performance bonus as a leverage to make his employees work harder. Rights is about using reference standards based on laws, rules, customs, norms or precedents to guide the disputes. “This is not the way we do things” or “We used to do it this way” are examples of rights-based moves. It works by providing legitimacy to the arguments by referencing a benchmark. Interests aims to settle an agreement by finding the underlying goals of the involved parties to resolve the conflict. This focuses on mutual benefits for both sides by getting past the stated demands and reveal the fundamental interests and feelings of the parties.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 21: Pitch Black Laser Tag.</p>

<h2 id="22-quid-pro-quo">22: Quid Pro Quo.</h2>

<p>Latin for “something for something”.  While it might have a negative connotation, quid pro quo helps to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement between two parties with differing opinions.  In order to reach this equilibrium,  there are 2 criteria must be met:
There are more than one issue on the table to allow trade-offs.
One has different preferences concerning these issues.
When we are clear about the issues that is most important to us, we allow ourselves to be  flexible on things that are not as critical. This allows us to mix and match different combinations of options we have. A classic example is the trade-offs between cheap, fast and good in delivery of goods. When we are certain which is factor is most important to us, we will be able to make concessions and provide a solution that is mutually beneficial to both parties. This helps to move the negotiations towards nash equilibrium which might not necessary be a 50-50 split on all the factors.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 22: Gardens by the Bay Night Light Show.</p>

<h2 id="23-trust">23: Trust.</h2>

<p>The development of relationships leads to a progression of trust. The first stage of trust is deterrence based trust. This form of trust is based on fear of reprisal when the trust is broken. It is common in the workplace where the superiors trust their employees to be professional and perform their tasks without micromanaging. The fear of having a bad reputation and affecting bonus helps to keep the trust in tact. The next level of trust is knowledge based trust. This comes from the predictability of the person through understanding the character of the person. A honest and open friend is likely to pay his portion of food when we foot the bill first as opposed to a sly friend who might seek to avoid paying his share. The highest level of trust is identification based trust when we share a common value system and posses the same intents. The aligned incentives minimise the effort to monitor the other party’s actions as we are sure that they would work towards the same goal. In a friendship, when both parties seek each other’s companionship to enrich our own life, this common incentive bond to form loyalty. Trusting me is your decision but proving you right is mine.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 23: Frisbee pickup.</p>

<h2 id="24-perspectives">24: Perspectives.</h2>

<p>The recent strife between the Lee family has surfaced a lot of different perspectives from each involved individual. They each told a different aspect of the same story to help portray a viewpoint which further their personal agendas. LWL wanted an extra share of the house, LHY wanted the house sold to get his share and LHL wanted to preserve the house for his father’s legacy. I have noticed myself switching my votes as times goes by when each party reveal their side of the story.
Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is perspective, not the truth. -Marcus Aurelis</p>

<p>New Experience ## 24: Tanuki Raw + 9.5 years JC anniversary.</p>

<h2 id="25-duality">25: Duality.</h2>

<p>We cannot see the light if there is no darkness. We cannot tell a lie without knowing the truth. We cannot understand life if we do not understand death.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 25: Thai movie.</p>

<h2 id="26-home">26: Home.</h2>

<p>Having lived 4 years in London, it was difficult for me to call it my second home. Don’t get me wrong. I made really good friendships there, had many good (and bad) memories and heck, probably ate more dim sum there than in Singapore. But it was hard to find a defining identity in such a cosmopolitan city. You cannot say you are a Londoner simply because you spoke British accent. You cannot become a Londoner because you complain about the weather for being too gloomy. You are not a Londoner because you go to plays and enjoy a pint at Weatherspoon. Because it is as possible to do all of this in any city in the world and you will not be recognised as a Londoner. On the other hand, a simple “lah” or “lor” and you  would immediately stick out as a Singaporean. Food culture of our people is so strong that even London has a dish called Singaporean noodle. And we never shun away from good deals no matter how long the queue is. And all of these, is my Singapore, my home.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 26: NDP NE Show.</p>

<h2 id="27-groupthink">27: Groupthink.</h2>

<p>In trying to minimize conflicts within the group and/or conform to a certain social norm, we refrain from proposing radical ideas and raising controversial issues. These pressures can come from the lack of empowerment to the speaker (where the boss makes all the decisions), illusion of invulnerability (where a leading group with excessive optimism takes unnecessary risks) and belief in inherent morality (morality arises directly from the codes of conduct of the majority). As a result. groupthink can result in dire consequences when decisions are made without thorough analytical examination. The biggest problem with groupthink is that we often deny that the problem exists due to consensus within the group. Thus, to break free from this mindset, we should:
 Break away from our individual mind guards and speak up.
Leader to set a conducive environment for open dialogue.
Get an expert (third party) view on the decisions made.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 27: Pulau Semakau.</p>

<h2 id="28-relative">28: Relative.</h2>

<p>We do not normally have an absolute determining value when making a choice. Our judgments and decisions are influenced by reference points that are initially presented to us. This provides an anchor which influences our subsequent perceptions about these points. Similarly, we feel that a system is unfair only when we compare our predicaments with other more fortunate souls. While using anchoring can help us with deriving quick estimations, this form of decision-making and sense-making using relativity can cloud our rational thinking process. To combat this biasness, I should set a personal aspiration point  that is based on facts underneath the hood and my personal values.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 28: Room makeover.</p>

<h2 id="29-priorities">29: Priorities.</h2>

<p>We are always fascinated at jugglers. However, when we try to do it ourselves, it is so frustrating that we cannot handle all of them at one go. This is the same struggle we have everyday trying to  juggle the priorities of life: family, work, friends, health and growth. My mind has been all over the place lately and I have been letting up on some of these balls. I need to find the balance to keep all of balls of priorities afloat.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 29: River Safari.</p>

<h2 id="30-chains">30: Chains.</h2>

<p>Culture, bureaucracy and societal norms form chains around the way we act and behave. Bound by these chains, we are kept in a state of equilibrium that stops the boat from rocking. However, these chains do not help propel our boat forward. The irony is that we bound ourselves to these chains and are kept within it because of the way it intertwines with all of us. To break free from the chains, I must:
Recognise that I am bounded by them.
Challenge them using my values and logic.
Find a new equilibrium that helps to open up new paths.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 30: Microsoft office.</p>

<h2 id="31-meritocracy">31: Meritocracy.</h2>

<p>Meritocracy is one of the core values that forms the foundation of the Singapore society. This helps to ensure that all citizens are treated fairly and justly by leveling the playing field regardless of our race, religion or financial status. This has enabled many Singaporeans from less fortunate backgrounds break free from the vicious cycle and climb up the social ladder. However, in the midst of chasing our dreams, meritocracy ingrained in us makes us believe that our success is solely due to our individual resolves and abilities. We managed to achieve these accomplishments not through connections or privileges, but by our own efforts. We forget about the help that we are given along the way, forget about the opportunities that were presented to us, forget about the system and society that are in place to make all our dreams come true. I am where I am today because of the values of the society, the friends I have and the family around me. Never forget.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 31: Henna.</p>

<h2 id="32-choices">32: Choices.</h2>

<p>Choices are hard when the alternative choices are comparative. Each of these choices are better in some factors but fall short in others; the opportunity costs of the choices are balance.  The key to making decisions on hard choices is to look at the factors and the values they represent. These values that resonate with me more would give certain factors higher proportion over the others, providing me a choice that is clear and mine.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 32: Army Daze 2.</p>

<h2 id="33-exceptional">33: Exceptional.</h2>

<p>Mao, Mandela, Gandhi, Churchill and LKY. These are exceptional people. These people are not the richest people in the world nor the smartest in the world. But what makes them great is the generosities of their ideas that changed the world. Through their fortitude, courage and perseverance, they made great contributions to move the societies a step forward. We are privileged and fortunate to have higher education and to live in a peaceful society. But this also means that we should have higher obligations to lead and carry the less privileged along with us. A candle loses nothing if it is used to light another.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 33: SG Night Festival.</p>

<h2 id="34-decision">34: Decision.</h2>

<p>State the decision to be made clearly.
List out all available choices.
Find out as much information as possible on each choice.
Eliminate undesirable choices.
Make decision and know why I made it.
Live with no regrets.</p>

<p>New Experience ## 34: Coup.</p>

<h2 id="35-xy-problem">35: XY Problem.</h2>

<p>Ref: <a href="http://xyproblem.info/">http://xyproblem.info/</a>
We often ask questions regarding our solution and how we go about implementing it. However, not being the expert in the field, the solution we have in mind might be sub-optimal. This results in a provided solution that may not go into solving the real issue. However, I feel that it is a happy problem. This problem arises because we are interested enough to have put in some thought to the problem and coming up with a potential solution. But we need to be wary to fall prey to this pitfall and recognise our own shortcomings. In doing so, we would be able to humbly approach people for help and share the root of the problem with them.</p>

<h2 id="36-work">36: Work.</h2>

<p>We live in a privileged society that no longer work in order to meet the cost of living. Simply holding a job in our society can realistically serve to meet the basic necessities such as food and housing (Slight over exaggeration here as there will always be less fortunate situations).
So why do we work and why do we chase for better jobs? To buy the latest gadgets and fashion to quell our craving for materialistic rewards? To fill our time with work so as to define our existence (and often our identity)? Or so we can impose our authorities upon others to show supremacy?
And why are work that actually matter get paid the least? Teachers, nurses, road-sweepers and all the minions in the office who do the actual work certainly get paid less than the financial consultants, traders and middle-management managers. There, I said it. While I agree that there is a need for middle management coordination, their work do not necessarily equate to more value and therefore should not be compensated more than the people(minions) who do the actual work. Only if they can prove that they are able to achieve multiplier effects due to their efforts, then can they be rewarded accordingly.
So what’s a good reason to work then? Fulfillment. We should work to fulfill our lives because we are learning, because we are creating value for the society by making other lives better and because it provides an opportunity for social engagement to fulfill our psychological needs. So don’t get threatened/convinced when a boss dangles promotion or performance bonus to get a work done. Instead, ask what opportunities and fulfillment I will be able to get from doing the work.</p>

<h2 id="37-work-hard-is-hard-work">37: Work Hard is Hard Work</h2>

<p>The general stereotype of Gen Y is that we are the strawberry generations who cannot undertake hardships. However, this is far from what I have observed from my circle of friends. I have seen quite a couple of my friends working really hard at their own professions. I admire their dedication to their work and taking pride in ensuring that they produce the best quality work. Some of them might be doing so to prove their worth,  some climbing the corporate ladder and others just as a distraction to fill up their life. Even if these hard work often come at a price, as they give up on their health, family, friends and personal well-being, they persevere because the work produced symbolises the kind of attitude they have, the kind of reliable people they are. Furthermore, the conviction to do this day after day takes tremendous amount of mental resilience. Given the right motivation and environment, I do believe our generation is willing to work hard at these hard work.</p>

<h2 id="39-overthink">39: Overthink</h2>

<p>We tend to overthink on issues that we are uncertain. We become unduly cautious and brood  over the information in an attempt to understand the situation better. This lead to needlessly long discussions about causes and potential impacts to deliberate over the next course of action. However, we fail to realise that this overthink phenomenon is because the knowledge we have are either incomplete or of low value. We might have the necessary information but we do not have the knowledge to comprehend, internalise and make sense of the information to make a firm action.</p>

<h2 id="41-tact">41: Tact</h2>

<p>The ability to communicate with sensitivity.  One might be brutally honest, irrefutably accurate and emotionally calm but the message can still hurt. Tact is a combination of emotional intelligence and situational awareness to bring the right message with the right tones and the right manner to the person.</p>

<h2 id="42-better-to-be-done-than-perfect">42: Better to be Done than Perfect</h2>

<p>With so many deadlines running in parallel, we do not have the luxury to look meticulously into every single detail. This would pressure us to either the delay the delivery of the project or submit a copy that is less than perfect. Delaying a project would immediately cause a dent in the trust of our customers. Although delivering a less than perfect product might potentially be disastrous in the client’s faith in our abilities, the notion of perfection usually sits only within our heads. The receivers do not have the same idea of perfection that we impose upon ourselves. Hence, it is better to deliver, seek opinions on the working product and work towards perfection.</p>

<h2 id="43-don-t-fret-the-small-stuff">43: Don’t Fret the Small Stuff</h2>

<p>We worry a lot. We worry about how much change we get from the cashier, we worry about whether if we brought everything we need along, we worry if the decisions we make are the best ones. Most of these small things do not matter in the grand scale of things but slowly wear us down and can potentially ruin our day&hellip; if we let them. So let it go&hellip;</p>

<p>Idealised Influence:   A charismatic personification of the values and mission of the organization.
Inspirational Motivation:  Talk optimistically and articulate a compelling  vision for the future through  encouraging a sense of team spirit and creating general enthusiasm—especially towards difficult challenges.<br />
Intellectual Simulation:  Seeks differing perspectives when solving problems, and gets others to look at those problems from a different angle as well.<br />
Individualise Consideration:  Spend time coaching and teaching their followers, and in doing so, promote self-development. They treat others as individuals, rather than simply group members, and identify the differing needs, abilities, and aspirations for those individuals.</p>

<h2 id="45-busyness-as-proxy-for-productivity">45: Busyness as Proxy for Productivity.</h2>

<p>In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.</p>

<h2 id="47-living">47: Living.</h2>

<p>Once you pass a certain age, life becomes nothing more than a process of continual loss. Things that are important to your life begin to slip out of your grasp, one after another, like a comb losing teeth. And the only things that come to take their place are worthless imitations. Your physical strength, your hopes, your dreams, your ideals, your convictions, all meaning, or, then again, the people you love: one by one, they fade away. Some announce their departure before they leave, while others just disappear all of a sudden without warning one day. And once you lose them you can never get them back. Your search for replacements never goes well. It’s all very painful—as painful as actually being cut with a knife. You will be turning thirty soon, Mr. Kawana, which means that, from now on, you will gradually enter that twilight portion of life—you will be getting older. You are probably beginning to grasp that painful sense that you are losing something, are you not?”</p>

<h2 id="48-siberian-northrailroad">48: SiBerian NorthRailRoad.</h2>

<p>How to deal with negative emotions:
Stop. This is the most important step. Instead of becoming wrapped up in the emotion or making an impulse decision, just stop. Decide to take a moment.
Breathe. Take a deep breath. This helps clear your mind, as well as helps physiologically calm down your brain.
Notice. Notice what you&rsquo;re experiencing on a moment to moment basis. What are you feeling in your body? What emotions are you experiencing? Is it static or is it changing? Does the emotion seem out of proportion compared to the trigger?
Reflect. What&rsquo;s causing the emotion? Is it the right response? Is a part of you feeling attacked, belittled or threatened? Is there a story to the experience you&rsquo;re having?
Respond. Think of all the different courses of actions you can take. Consider the kindest, most compassionate way to respond to the situation (even if you don&rsquo;t take that path.) Finally, make a conscious decision on how to respond.</p>

<h2 id="49-set-the-stage">49: Set the Stage.</h2>

<p>To set the stage right for everyone in the meeting, we should invite everyone in the room to make the following assumptions about everyone else:
Assume that everybody in this room is here to serve the greater good, until proven otherwise.
Given the above assumption, we therefore assume that none of us has any hidden agenda, until proven otherwise.
Given the above assumption, we therefore assume that we are all reasonable even when we disagree, until proven otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="50-compassion">50: Compassion</h2>

<p>The 3 components that make up compassion are: 1) A cognitive component: “I understand you” 2) An affective component: “I feel for you” and 3) A motivational component: “I want to help you”. These components of compassion help to build the distinguish qualities of a Level 5 leaders: a) “Personal Humility”: Understanding people and empathising with them by using the cognitive and affective components. b) “Great Ambition”: Creating ambition for greater good through wanting to help people as a motivating factor.
