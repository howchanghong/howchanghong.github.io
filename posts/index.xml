      <description>Instead of throwing out empty motivational speeches or trying to depend on a few superstars to carry the organisation, it is the job of the leader to architect a system that helps to drive a enterprising culture and mold the behaviours of its people. When the system&amp;rsquo;s conditions, connections and culture is right, each individual will be able to assemble themselves and align their senses of worth to the organisation&amp;rsquo;s direction.</description>

      <description>Our notion of truth is based on the information and knowledge we possess at this point of time. We formulate our world and logic surrounding this state of time and call this information &amp;ndash; truth. However, as our world changes, the information and knowledge can change overtime which alters the truth.
Truth is temporal.</description>

      <description>Work has been life these days and the bustling pace can be overwhelming without giving myself a time to reflect. Seeing my brother’s note to do this particular challenge, I’m inspired to do personal reflections myself too. In addition, after making a bet with Yunhan, I shall attempt to make a new experience every week. Thus, the objectives of this challenge are: Reflect on events that happened this week and, How I felt, what influenced my decisions and what can be done better.</description>
